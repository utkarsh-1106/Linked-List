# Linked-List
A javascript program to implement the data structure "Linked List". A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers. A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list. 
This program contains various linked list properties:
1. Append: To add a node at the end of the linked list and initialize it with the given value.
2. Prepend: To add a node at the start of the linked list and initialize it with the given value.
3. Insert: To insert the node at the required index in the linked list and initialize it with the given value.
4. Print List: To print the entire linked list.
5. Remove: To delete the node from the linked list at the given index.
6. Pop: To delete the last node of the linked list.
